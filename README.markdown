openssl-xcode
=============

This is an XCode project skeleton structure that can be used to build a static 
libcrypto.a library for use in Mac and iPhone projects. 

It is specifically intended for use in building secure iPhone 
applications alongside [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net), 
but it can easily be used for other applications.

## Discontinued

This project is no longer being actively maintained by Zetetic, LLC.

It was originally created to help build SQLCipher for Apple platforms using OpenSSL as the crypto provider. It was no longer needed once Common Crypto became the crypto provider for SQLCipher on these platforms. For help building SQLCipher and including it in an Xcode project, [please see this tutorial](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/ios-tutorial/).

Usage
-----

In a normal case you would use it thusly:

1. Download the OpenSSL source code directly from
   http://www.openssl.org/source/ 
2. Clone the openssl-xcode git repo to make a local copy
3. Either:
   a. Put the downloaded OpenSSL source tar.gz into the same folder
      as openssl.xcodeproj.  
   b. Place an extracted OpenSSL distribution in a folder called 'openssl'
      within the same folder as openssl.xcodeproj
   c. Extracted the OpenSSL distribution directly into the same folder 
      as openssl.xcodeproj.
   d. Setup a source tree definition in XCode for OPENSSL_SRC pointing the
      folder containing openssl source code

Then, either open openssl.xcodeproj in XCode and initiate a build, or integrate
it within another project:

1. Drag the openssl.xcodeproj file into your main project
2. Right-click on your project target, and add openssl.xcodeproj under "Direct
   Dependencies" on the General tab.
3. On the Build tab for your project's target, find the "Header Search Paths" 
   option, and add the path:
   > `$(SRCROOT)/Library/openssl/build/openssl.build/openssl/include`
   
   (Assuming you've put openssl.xcodeproj at the path Library/openssl, and are
   building from a source tarball)
4. Expand your target's "Link Binary With Libraries" build stage, and drag
   libcrypto.a from the openssl.xcodeproj group.


This project actually relies on the OpenSSL configure and make
system to build the libraries. However, it does attempt to automatically
detect and use the appropriate build settings for arch (i386/ppc/armv6),
build tools, and SDK directories. This makes it appropriate for inclusion
as a project reference into an iPhone application project. This project will
also check to see if the resulting crypto library is newer than the project
Makefile to avoid time consuming rebuild cycles.
